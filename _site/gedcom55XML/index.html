<h1>GEDCOM 5.5 XML</h1>
<p>The genealogical markup language that I call "GEDCOM 5.5 XML"
and the XML schema that I wrote to describe it are the result of
a personal project. I had a GEDCOM file, full of my family's
history. It was produced by the Open Source program <a class=
"ulink" href="http://lifelines.sourceforge.net/">Lifelines</a>, which requires users to manually enter
genealogical data line by GEDCOM line. It performs no error
checking. As my GEDCOM file grew to 20,000 lines, I decided to
clean it up and correct all its syntax errors.</p>

<p>I knew that if I could convert my file into a <a class="ulink"
href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a> document, I
could validate it, in the XML sense, and find all the syntax
errors. I simply needed to run the XML file through a validation
parser, testing it against a <a class="ulink" href=
"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#dt-doctype">DTD</a>
description of the markup language.</p>

<p>I thought I found my solution in <a class="ulink" href=
"http://homepage.ntlworld.com/michael.h.kay/gedml/">GedML</a>, a genealogical XML markup language <a class=
"ulink" href=
"http://lists.xml.org/archives/xml-dev/199804/msg00282.html">proposed</a> by Michael H. Kay of Saxon fame. He
released a <a class="ulink" href=
"http://users.breathe.com/mhkay/gedml/dtd.html">DTD</a> that describes this markup language. He also
released a <a class="ulink" href=
"http://homepage.ntlworld.com/michael.h.kay/gedml/">Java program</a> that could convert a GEDCOM file into a
XML document. The DTD, however, did not describe the markup
language produced by the converter. It couldn't be used to
validate a converted GEDCOM file.</p>

<p>The markup language produced by his converter, though, is
quite simple: all GEDCOM tags are translated into XML elements;
open and closed elements delimit the data; and the elements are
nested in the same way prescribed by the <a class="ulink" href=
"http://homepages.rootsweb.com/~pmcbride/gedcom/55gctoc.htm">GEDCOM</a> specification. The markup diverges from
the specification with respect to the <code class=
"literal">TRLR</code> tag. Kay's converter eliminates this tag
which indicates the end of a GEDCOM file. Kay probably considered
this element unnecessary because a closed XML document root
element serves the same purpose.</p>

<p>All I needed, then, was a XML schema that described the markup
produced by the converter. I ruled out a DTD; it couldn't capture
all of the restrictions prescribed by the GEDCOM specification. I
wrote, instead, a XML schema in <a class="ulink" href=
"http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/relax-ng/spec-20011203.html"
>RELAX NG</a> and embedded <a class="ulink" href=
"http://www.schematron.com/">Schematron</a> rules
in it.</p>

<p>The resulting schema almost completely describes the full
GEDCOM 5.5 specification in XML markup. There are, however, a few
places where it does not. These are duly noted in the
documentation below. Since the schema has a few shortcomings, I
have designated it version "0.1". When the schema describes 100
percent of the GEDCOM 5.5 specification, the version number will
be incremented to "1.0".</p>

<p>I call the XML markup described by the schema "GEDCOM 5.5
XML". This name differentiates it from Kay's GedML, with its
limited DTD and with its implementation that leaves out the <code
class="literal">TRLR</code> tag. GEDCOM 5.5 XML attempts to be a
100 percent one-to-one translation of GEDCOM 5.5 into XML; it
even includes the superfluous (and empty) <code class=
"literal">&lt;TRLR/&gt;</code> element.</p>
