It's been a while since I've posted anything, but I'm going to start
posting about personal projects that have worked on over the years,
as a publish them on my [github account](https://github.com/neomanticx).

The first project I have pushed to github is called
["Announce My Agenda"](https://github.com/neomantic/announce-my-agenda-app). It's
an Android app that uses Android's Text-to-Speech capability to read
out-loud your day's agenda, given the Google calendars you have
selected, and the invitations your have accepted. It was written over a
year, and I never gave it the final polish to publish it in Google's
Play store.

I'm releasing it under the GPLv3 license.

Please keep in mind that I'm not a Java developer, but a Ruby
developer by profession, so this might not be the most elegant Java
code. The app, though, is nearly fully functional.
