I have scrapped the original Radiant site for a [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) static site.
Jekyll is fantastic.  The original styles have been thrown out too.  Both changes are designed to
make the site easier to update and maintain.  Many of the site's pages do not match
the home page/post styles, but resemble docbook html pages; that's because they are.
I doubt I'll ever migrate them.
