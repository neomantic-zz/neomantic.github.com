After all the gems I've written for my employer, I'm finally releasing one
of my own: [guard-rackunit](https://rubygems.org/gems/guard-rackunit).
The gem in a [Guard](https://github.com/guard/) which runs
[Racket's](http:/racket-lang.org) [RackUnit](http://docs.racket-lang.org/rackunit/index.html) unit tests.

The source code is hosted on
[github](https://github.com/neomantic/guard-rackunit). Consult the
README for details about installing and running the gem.
