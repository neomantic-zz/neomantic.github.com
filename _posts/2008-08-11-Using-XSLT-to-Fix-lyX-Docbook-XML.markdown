title: Using XSLT to Fix lyX's Docbook XML
layout: post
---
[lyX](http://www.lyx.org/) is currently my favorite text editor,
especially when it comes to writing software documentation. LyX's
support for [Docbook XML](http://www.docbook.org/) is slightly cludgy, though, because the application is really
designed to help create LaTex documents. I have written a tutorial
on how to use lyX to produce Docbook XML which can be transformed
into XHTML or PDF documents. This tutorial shows how to
leverage XML technologies, such as XSL, to create customized versions
of Docbook XSL stylesheets that fix some of lyX's Docbook problems.
The tutorial can be read [here](tutorials/lyx-and-docbookXML).
